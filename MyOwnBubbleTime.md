# My Own Bubble Time

My Own Bubble Time is a relaxing game made for Android devices. 

In this project I was the main programmer. The game was made with a team of five persons.

## What did I learn?

I learned how to implement a object pooling system. The object pooling system was used to pool the bubbles. I also got a bit more familiar with the profiler tool since I was constantly trying to improve the performance. 

In addition I implemented a saving system that saves the state of the player profile and that was a good learning experience because now I know that I will not be doing it the same way (It was overly complicated). 

Once again I got more experience how to work in a team.
