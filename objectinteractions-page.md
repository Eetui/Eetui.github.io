## Goals fo the course
My goal was to write modular and cleaner code.

## What did I learn?

I fulfilled my goal and managed to write modular and better code

I learned SOLID-principles on some level and how to implement them into my code.

I also learned how to implement events with Scriptable Objects and how to use Scriptable Objects overall.

In addition I used interfaces on this project and became more familiar with them.

And thousand little things what comes when making a project.
